    Executive Orders: Issuance and Revocation
    Summary
    Executive orders and proclamations are used extensively by Presidents to achieve policy goals,
    set uniform standards for managing the executive branch, or outline a policy view intended to
    influence the behavior of private citizens. The Constitution does not define these presidential
    instruments and does not explicitly vest the President with the authority to issue them.
    Nonetheless, such orders are accepted as an inherent aspect of presidential power, and, if based
    on appropriate authority, they have the force and effect of law. This report discusses the nature of
    executive orders and proclamations, with a focus on the scope of presidential authority to execute
    such instruments and judicial and congressional responses thereto.
    In the 111" Congress, several bills have been introduced regarding the revocation and
    modification of executive orders: H.R. 35, H.R. 500/S. 237, H.R. 603, H.R. 1228, H.R. 3465,
    H.R. 4453, and S. 2929. Other bills on executive orders proposed in this Congress are prescriptive
    and contain provisions that do not necessarily revoke or require alteration of executive orders:
    H.R. 21, H.R. 292, H.R. 669, H.R. 1082, H.R. 1367, H.R. 3293, S. 237, and S. 2929. In some
    cases, these bills may expand upon existing executive orders.
    The 111" Congress has also passed several laws with provisions related to existing executive
    orders: P.L. 111-5, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA); P.L. 111-8,
    the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009; P.L. 111-80, the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food
    and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2010; and P.L. 111-117, the
    Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010. Additionally, President Obama has issued an executive
    order titled Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act’s Consistency with Longstanding
    Restrictions on the Use of Federal Funds for Abortion, which was discussed during the House
    floor debate on H.R. 3590/P.L. 111-148.
